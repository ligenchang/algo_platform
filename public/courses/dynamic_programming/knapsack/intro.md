# Knapsack Problem - Introduction

The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the most valuable subset of items that can fit within a knapsack of limited capacity. Each item may be chosen at most once.

This challenge will guide you through understanding the problem, developing a dynamic programming solution, and implementing it in Python.
