# Knapsack Problem - Tests

The tests exercise common edge cases:

- Empty item list
- Small capacities
- Items heavier than capacity
- Multiple items with same weight

The test harness is in `knapsack_tests.py` and defines a `run_tests(knapsack_func)` function that returns a list of results for each case. Use the Editor's "Run Tests" button to execute the harness.
